# Affordable-sdr-spectrometer-

This project is a simple and affordable way to scan and image large portions of the radio spectrum using an RTL-SDR and Python. 

It records raw IQ data from the SDR, saves and ogonises it into HDF5 files, and then processes and displays them as a waterfall graph. Its designed to be modular, affordable and relatively lightweight to use it to record out in the field.

This code was mainly focused on the 700 MHz to 2 GHz range with some tests also taken in the lower FM Radio range. But this depends on your antenna and SDR.
